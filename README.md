## Overview
This Python script implements a neural network-based chatbot assistant that can:
- Understand user intents from natural language input
- Provide appropriate responses
- Execute special functions for certain intents
- Be trained on custom intent patterns

## Main Components

### 1. Core Classes

#### `ChatbotModel` (Neural Network)
- A 3-layer feedforward neural network implemented with PyTorch
- Architecture:
  - Input layer → Hidden layer 1 (ReLU activation)
  - Hidden layer 1 → Hidden layer 2 (ReLU activation)
  - Hidden layer 2 → Output layer
- Includes dropout layers for regularization

#### `ChatbotAssistant` (Main Handler)
- Manages the complete chatbot workflow:
  - Intent parsing and vocabulary building
  - Data preparation and model training
  - Response generation
  - Model saving/loading

### 2. Key Functionality

#### Natural Language Processing
- Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK
- Bag-of-words representation for text inputs
- Intent classification based on trained patterns

#### Training System
- Data preparation from JSON intents file
- Neural network training with:
  - Validation split
  - Early stopping
  - Loss tracking
- Model serialization/deserialization

#### Response Handling
- Static responses from intents file
- Dynamic function execution for special intents
- Fallback mechanisms for unknown inputs

### 3. Data Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load intents from JSON file
   - Build vocabulary and document patterns
   - Initialize neural network dimensions

2. **Training Mode**:
   - Create bag-of-words representations
   - Split data into train/validation sets
   - Train model with early stopping
   - Save best model weights

3. **Prediction Mode**:
   - Process user input (tokenize, lemmatize)
   - Convert to bag-of-words
   - Predict intent using neural network
   - Generate appropriate response

### 4. Configuration

#### Hyperparameters
- Batch size: 8
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Epochs: 100
- Validation split: 20%
- Early stopping patience: 10 epochs

#### File Handling
- Default files:
  - intents.json (input patterns/responses)
  - chatbot_model.pth (model weights)
  - dimensions.json (network dimensions)

### 5. Special Features

- **Function Mapping**: Certain intents can trigger Python functions (e.g., stock recommendations)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and validation
- **Interactive Mode**: Command-line chat interface
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend with new intents/functions


### 6. Dependencies

- Core: Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - PyTorch (neural network)
  - NLTK (text processing)
  - NumPy (numerical operations)
